#When to begin designing
### Required before stating to design the architecture
### functional requirements
### overall quality

## Generate and Test
* view the current design as a hypothesis
+ ask whether the current design satisfies the requirements
- if not then generate a new hypothesis

### Attribute-Driven Design
* Input
*
* Recursive
* Output

### ADD Steps (process)
1. Choose the module to decompose
2. Refine the module
  * Choose the architectural drivers from quality 
  * h
  * Instantiate modules and allocate functionality
  * d. Define interfaces of the child
